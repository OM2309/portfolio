        I’m 22-year-old guy from Gwalior. I’ve completed my BCA and have 2 years
        of experience working at a startup based in Jaipur. I’ve worked on
        building mobile and web applications from scratch. I enjoy coding,
        learning new technologies, and creating things that make people’s lives
        easier.
